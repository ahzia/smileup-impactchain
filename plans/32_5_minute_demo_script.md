**"The Social Impact Gap"**

*Visual: Split screen showing social media feeds vs. real-world impact*

- 90% of social media engagement doesn't translate to action
- $2.3 trillion needed annually to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goals
- Current donation platforms are fragmented and lack transparency
