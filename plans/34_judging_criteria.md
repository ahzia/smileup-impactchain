## ðŸŽ¯ **JUDGING CRITERIA BREAKDOWN**

### **INNOVATION (10%)**

The extent to which the solution is new, or previously unseen in the hedera ecosystem (See: Hedera Network Ecosystem). The solution may introduce new capabilities to the ecosystem, or use the hedera network services to create a previously unseen solution.

**Guiding Points:**
- Does the team's project align to the hackathon track?
- How innovative is the solution? Does this exist cross-chain?
- Has something like this been seen before in the Hedera ecosystem?
- Does this extend, or establish new, capabilities for the Hedera ecosystem?

### **FEASIBILITY (10%)**

The extent to which the idea can be created using the Hedera network services, and optionally the ecosystem platforms. The viability to which the idea can be crafted into a sustainable business, with an appropriate business model. The extent to which the solution can be deployed early to gain feedback / traction and can grow and develop with the business / market needs.

**Guiding Points:**
- Can the proposed idea be created using Hedera network services or ecosystem platforms?
- Does this need to be a Web3 solution? Or could it be done already on Web2?
- Does the team understand the problem space / domain that they're solving?
- Does the team understand what's required to execute the solution, and have the capability to do so?
- Did the team create, and understand, a Lean / Business Model Canvas to illustrate the business model intended to be used as part of the solution being created?

---

### **EXECUTION (20%)**

The extent to which the team delivered on the execution of the solution they were proposing to create.

**Guiding Points:**
- Were the team able to create a MVP for their solution?
- Did the team deliver a Proof of Concept (PoC) with a limited, but important, set of features?
- Did the team create a fully functioning solution?
- Did the team function well together and work to each other's strengths? Was there effective leadership within the team?
- Did the team establish a strategy and long-term plan for the development of the solution beyond the hackathon?
- Did the team identify a Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy for the solution?
- Did the team identify where they could use market feedback cycles to improve the solution / idea?
- Did the team identify important design decisions they made?
- Did the team have a good emphasis on user experience/accessibility?

---

### **INTEGRATION (15%)**

The extent to which the solution is integrated into the Hedera network or its ecosystem partners, or platforms. Is Hedera a significant aspect of the solution's capabilities, or are they being leveraged in a fundamental way to underpin the purpose of the solution meaningfully?

**Guiding Points:**
- To what degree does the project use the Hedera network?
- How integrated is it? What services are used?
- Are any of our ecosystem platforms being used, or leveraged?
- Is a Hedera service being integrated in a way it hasn't been seen before? (creativity)

---

### **SUCCESS (20%)**

The extent to which the project impacts the growth and traction of the Hedera network and ecosystem.

**Guiding Points:**
- Does the solution positively impact the Hedera network or ecosystem?
- Does the solution lead to more Hedera accounts being created?
- Does the solution give rise to a high number of monthly active Hedera accounts?
- Does the solution lead to greater TPS on the Hedera network?
- Does the solution give the Hedera network exposure to a greater audience?

---

### **VALIDATION (15%)**

The extent to which the project is validated by market feedback (e.g. users/customers). Validation involves engaging outsiders to test and/or make purchases, along with providing feedback. It can also involve soft commitment from potential partners in the Web2 and Web3 world.

**Guiding Points:**
- Did the team identify where to gain market feedback? e.g. ask users / customers, partners, practitioners, subject matter experts (SMEs) etc.
- Did the team establish one or more market feedback cycles? e.g. Following up with users that tried the product to ask for feedback, or a review?
- What traction with the market have the team achieved?
- Onboarded early adopters | Free / Paid trials? | Taken any revenue? | What is the market sentiment? | What is the growth / churn rate?

---

### **PITCH (10%)**

The extent to which the project pitch explains the pain point(s), solution (incl. use of Hedera), traction (to date), opportunity (growth, revenue & partnerships), and future plans of the project. Please note that providing a demo video is crucial. Submissions without one may be disqualified, so ensure it is included.

**Guiding Points:**
- Are the problem and solution presented clearly?
- Is the problem big enough for sustained growth?
- Is the style and narrative of the pitch well thought out & executed?
- Were the team able to convey a significant & exciting opportunity?
- Did the number / metrics of the solution make sense?
- How was Hedera represented in the pitch?
- Were suitable responses to questions given?
- Do they clearly state their MVP's features & why they chose those / them?
